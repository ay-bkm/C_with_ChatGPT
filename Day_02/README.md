**Day 2: Arrays and Functions**

**Concepts:**
1. Arrays:
   - An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
   - Arrays are indexed starting from 0, meaning the first element is accessed with index 0, the second with index 1, and so on.
   - To declare an array, you specify the data type and the number of elements it will hold, like this: `int myArray[5];`.

2. Accessing Array Elements:
   - You can access array elements using their index. For example, to access the third element of an array `myArray`, you use `myArray[2]` (remember, indexing starts from 0).

3. Functions:
   - Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task.
   - Functions help break down the code into smaller, manageable units and improve code reusability.
   - Functions have a return type, a name, parameters (if any), and a function body.

4. Function Prototypes:
   - A function prototype (also called function declaration) tells the compiler about the function's name, return type, and parameters before the function is defined or called.
   - It helps the compiler verify that the function is used correctly.

**Exercises:**
Now, let's proceed with some exercises to practice arrays and functions.

**Exercise 1: Sum of Array Elements**
Write a C function that takes an integer array and its size as parameters and returns the sum of all elements in the array.


**Exercise 2: Finding the Maximum Element**
Write a C function that takes an integer array and its size as parameters and returns the maximum element in the array.


**Exercise 3: Reversing an Array**
Write a C function that takes an integer array and its size as parameters and reverses the elements of the array in-place.


These exercises will help you get hands-on experience with arrays and functions in C. Remember to run the code and verify the output to understand how the functions operate on the arrays. Feel free to experiment with the code, make changes, and come up with your variations of these exercises to reinforce your understanding.
